# Vegetable-Recognition-System

## Overview

The Vegetable Scanning API enables standard webcams to scan and identify vegetables, similar to barcode scanning. It integrates seamlessly into POS (Point of Sale) systems, automating the identification and billing process for untagged produce in retail and grocery businesses.

## Key Features

-   **Real-Time Identification:** Uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize vegetables from webcam input.
-   **POS Integration:** Easily integrates into existing billing software, allowing automated entry of vegetable names and prices.
-   **High Accuracy:** Trained on a vast dataset of vegetable images to ensure precise identification.
-   **User-Friendly API:** Simple REST or WebSocket-based API with minimal setup required.
-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works with Windows, macOS, and Linux POS systems.
-   **Customizable Pricing:** Allows stores to configure pricing based on weight or unit.

## Use Cases

-   **Supermarkets & Grocery Stores:** Automates billing for fresh produce, reducing manual input errors.
-   **Self-Checkout Systems:** Enhances self-service kiosks by enabling easy vegetable identification.
-   **Farmers' Markets & Local Vendors:** Helps small businesses streamline their sales process.

## Technology Stack

-   **Machine Learning Model:** CNN-based image recognition trained on a diverse vegetable dataset.
-   **Frameworks:** TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, OpenCV for image processing.
-   **API Development:** FastAPI or Flask for lightweight and high-performance API deployment.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB for storing vegetable classifications and metadata.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Weight Estimation:** Integration with digital scales for auto-weight capture.
-   **Multi-Language Support:** Recognition of vegetable names in different languages.
-   **Mobile App SDK:** Allowing smartphone cameras to use the API for identification.
